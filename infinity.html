                <h1>Infinity ESSENSE</h1>
                <p>
                    The Infiniti Essence is a concept sports car designed by Infiniti to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Infiniti brand.[1] The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show.[2] [3] The car is a hybrid electric vehicle and is among the first energy-efficient cars Infiniti has released.[4]
                    The vehicle was designed by Infiniti design director Takashi Nakajima.[5] Its external appearance is a modern interpretation of "coke bottle styling", a feature that was very popular during the 1960s and 1970s internationally. The interior design was initially conceived (Paul Ray) in the Nissan Design Europe studio based in Paddington, London. Following the interior concept being chosen it was then further developed and built in Japan.
                    The Essence concept is not expected to enter production, but elements from the car were planned to be incorporated into later Infiniti models.[6]

                <h1>Infinity Emerg-E</h1>
                <p>
                    The Infiniti Emerg-E is a concept sports car developed by the Infiniti division of Nissan Motors and was unveiled to the public at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show.[1]
                    It is based on the Lotus Evora platform and the hybrid powertrain shown in 2012 as the Lotus 414E concept car.[2] The Emerg-E has two electric motors, one powering each rear wheel, producing a total of 402 bhp (300 kW; 408 PS) with 738 lb⋅ft (1,001 N⋅m) of torque, and providing acceleration to 60 mph (97 km/h) in four seconds. The Emerg-E has a 30 mi (48.3 km) electric-only range, after which a small 47 bhp (35 kW; 48 PS) three-cylinder 1.2 L (1,200 cc) petrol engine kicks in to recharge the lithium-ion battery pack. The car can also be plugged in to recharge.[3]

                    The mid-engined two-seater sports car may not reach production, but was shown as a working prototype at the 2012 Goodwood Festival of Speed.

                <h1>Third generation (F50)</h1>
                <p>
                    Introduced as a concept at the 2000 New York Auto Show, the Q45 was completely redesigned for 2002 and was heavily based on the JDM Cima. This Q45 focused on performance again with a new 340 hp (253 kW) 4.5 L VK45DE V8 engine, HID headlights, and revised styling. The car featured a 5-speed automatic transmission with overdrive.
                    Development began in 1996, with exterior designs under Mamori Aoki frozen in 1998 and patented in March 2000.[10][11] It was the first Infiniti with laser autonomous cruise control system.
                    1129 Q45s were sold in the United States for 2005. The 3rd generation Q45 reviewed by Car and Driver, Edmunds and Consumer Guide, receiving relative positive reviews.[12][13][14][15]
                    The 2003 model received a revised security system, numerically higher final drive ratio (for better acceleration - decreased highway fuel economy), reprogrammed TCU, and a mid-year satellite radio option. The CD changer could load CDs directly at the dashboard head unit. The 2005 Q45 received revised front and rear fascias, hood, grille, trunk lid and headlights, integrated fog lights and LED taillights, contoured double-stitched seating, white luminescent gauge markings, chrome accents, dark maple trim, recalibrated transmission and new 17" alloy wheels.
                    Standard equipment included a leather interior, power sunroof, 8-way power front seats, remote keyless entry, rain-detecting wipers and side curtain airbags. Standard electronics include: CD, 8 speaker Bose audio system, trip computer, rear view parking camera system, and voice-activated navigation system. The 2002 Q45 was the first vehicle to ever offer voice-activated navigation controls and a reverse parking camera outside Japan, following the JDM 1991 Toyota Soarer. The car seated five passengers and was offered at MSRP of US$56,200 (equivalent to $84,669 in 2021).
