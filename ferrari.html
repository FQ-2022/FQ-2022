                <h1> FERRARI 488 PISTA SPIDER 2018</h1>
                 <p>
                    In parallel with the launch of the Ferrari 488 Pista in 2018, an open-top variant was introduced. The model called Spider is not intended to set records on the tracks (for the conversion to be more stable at high speeds, it should be heavier, and this will negatively affect the dynamic characteristics). Compared to its analogue, this model, sharpened for driving on ideal roads, shows more comfort, so rich motorists prefer a convertible.

                <h1> FERRARI 488 SPIDER 2015</h1>
                <p>
                    Despite the fact that the sports car Ferrari 488 Spider was presented as a new model in 2015, it is actually another evolution of the 458 Italia and an open modification of the 488GTB. At the time of presentation, it was the most powerful convertible of the Italian manufacturer. This model is of particular interest technically, because its exterior and interior have already been perfected.

                <h1>FERRARI 812SUPERFAST 2017</h1>
                <p>
                    In 2017, the F12 berlinetta was replaced by the Ferrari 812superfast. The previous sports car underwent a deep modernization and received the motor produced for the flagship of the Italian manufacturer. The exterior design concept was inspired by the 365GTB4 Daytona (1969). The coupe turned out to be elegant and at the same time had excellent aerodynamic properties.

                <p>
                    The Ferrari GTC2016lusso sports coupe made its debut at the 4th Geneva Motor Show. Although the model is positioned as a novelty, in fact it is a familiar FF, only undergoing a deep restyling. Unlike the corresponding supercars presented a little earlier, this car got four-wheel drive.
